      question: "Why do TikTok coin prices vary by country?",
      answer: "TikTok adjusts coin prices based on local currency values, purchasing power, and regional market conditions. This ensures fair pricing across different economies."
    },
    {
      question: "Which country has the cheapest TikTok coins?",
      answer: "Coin prices vary frequently, but generally countries with weaker currencies may have relatively cheaper coin rates. However, this is balanced by TikTok's regional pricing strategy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I buy TikTok coins from a different country?",
      answer: "TikTok detects your location and applies local pricing. Using VPNs or changing locations to get cheaper coins may violate TikTok's terms of service."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there bulk discounts for TikTok coins?",
      answer: "Yes, larger coin packages typically offer better value per coin. The per-coin cost usually decreases as you purchase larger quantities."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do TikTok coin prices change?",
      answer: "TikTok coin prices are generally stable but can change based on currency fluctuations, regional economic conditions, and platform updates."
    }
