      question: "How much does TikTok pay per 1000 views?",
      answer: "TikTok doesn't pay directly for views. Creators earn money through the Creator Fund, live gifts, and brand partnerships. Live gifts are the primary way to earn from TikTok coins."
    },
    {
      question: "What percentage does TikTok take from gifts?",

    },
    {
      question: "When can I withdraw my TikTok earnings?",

    },
    {
      question: "Are there other ways to earn on TikTok?",
