## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom TikTok brand colors
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript-first approach
- **Schema Location**: Shared schema in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Tables**: Tools, Countries, Gifts, Blog Posts, Recharge Packages
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations

## Key Components

### Data Models
1. **Tools**: Calculator and utility tools with metadata
2. **Countries**: Currency information and coin exchange rates
3. **Gifts**: TikTok gift database with coin costs and diamond values
4. **Blog Posts**: SEO-optimized content management
5. **Recharge Packages**: Country-specific coin pricing packages

### Calculator Tools
1. **Coin Calculator**: Convert TikTok coins to real money
2. **Gift Value Estimator**: Calculate gift costs in real currency
3. **Earnings Calculator**: Estimate creator income from gifts
4. **Recharge Comparison**: Compare coin prices across countries
5. **Coin to Diamond Converter**: Internal currency conversion
6. **Withdrawal Calculator**: Calculate net earnings after fees

### Storage Layer
- **Interface**: IStorage interface for data operations
- **Implementation**: MemStorage class with in-memory data store
- **Initialization**: Pre-populated with sample data for tools, countries, and gifts
- **Future**: Designed to be replaced with database-backed storage

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls using TanStack Query
2. **API Routes**: Express routes handle CRUD operations for different entities
3. **Storage Layer**: Storage interface abstracts data access
4. **Response**: JSON responses sent back to client
5. **State Management**: React Query handles caching and synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: React with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns library

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation
- **Session Storage**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Development**: NODE_ENV=development for development mode
- **Production**: NODE_ENV=production for production builds

### Serving Strategy
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR and middleware mode
- **Production**: Express serves static files from `dist/public`
- **API**: Express routes handle `/api/*` endpoints
- **Fallback**: SPA routing handled by serving index.html

### SEO Optimization
- **Meta Tags**: Dynamic SEO meta tags for each page
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD schema markup
- **Canonical URLs**: Proper canonical URLs for each page
- **OpenGraph**: Social media sharing optimization

The application is designed with a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend with new calculators, add database persistence, or modify the UI components. The modular architecture allows for independent development of frontend and backend components while maintaining type safety through shared schemas.
